				<h1>TIMPANI</h1>
				<h4>August 8, 2017</h4>
				<p>Find an interesting fact about timpani. For the final sound in Concert Piece for Timpani and Orchestra by Maurizio Kagel, THE PLAYER HITS HIS HEAD INTO THE DRUM??!! The drum is not used until the last second; it is specifically for the final head-smash. The drumhead is made from fragile material, otherwise it will not be broken (and the player will get hurt?). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6lWTpOH3q8&amp=&amp=&amp=&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Click here to watch the video.</a></p>
